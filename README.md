# push_swap
push_swap is a project which requires an algorithm to sort number in as few movements as possible. You can find the subject <a href="https://github.com/rphlr/42-Subjects/blob/main/common-core/push_swap/en.subject.pdf">here</a> For my project I used a modified version of the so-called Turk algorithm; there is a better explanation than the one I would ever provide <a href="https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97">here</a>. The algorithm had some flaws so I had to change it a bit, but in essence it's the same and allows a good sortition with a normally comfortable margin of movements.
This project was validated on 16th May 2024

<h3>Things to improve:</h3>
The algorithm can surpass the maximum number of movements allowed for maximum marks in rare cases of 500 numbers.
